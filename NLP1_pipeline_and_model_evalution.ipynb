I just do not understand how I can go on from being so pleasantly fine to suicidal and self loathing within in minutes and not be able to step out of it. I have been suffering from poor mental health for over 10 years and I am about to turn 26 next week and I feel so ashamed for how serious my negative thoughts are. Covid was a hard transition especially having moved to a new city a few months before everything started locking down, but now I am here and settled and I have a loving partner, a great connection to their family, a really fun job and I finished my degree. But when I stop and look around I feel like nothing will ever be good enough for me and I will never be good enough, I will always have skin problems and bad teeth and acne. I will never be the artist I used to be (I have a Bachelor in fine art) because I do not have the same drive or passionate that I used to have for it. I will never have the career I built my entire plan around because I am losing my interest in art. I will never have the relationship with my family that I want because I could not stand to stay in my hometown. All I can feel is this tornado of my failures swirling around me all the damn time. It just seems that no matter how many positives come my way they do not last long enough to out weight the negatives.

       "I do not know if this is the right place for this.I just feel sad a lot, the only time I am not sad is when I am with friends, but as soon as that is gone its like a switch and I am sad again.I want to feel justified for having all these sad feelings and I do not want to get up, when I have all these good things around me. So sometimes I want bad things to happen to me like I just wish something bad could happen so I could feel justified, and wanting bad things to happen makes me feel like attention whore.I just feel like I have it much better off than most and I am selfish for feeling sad all the time I just wish I could just appreciate what good things I have but I cannot and I do not know why.I am really sorry this is probably all over the place and does not make sense. Why am I sad when everything is good?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   depression    0.0                  1\n",
       "you are lonely. I get it. I am too. You might have friends, family, a bf or a gf, people that you love.. but you still feel lonely. Like no one can even understand a tiny bit about you, about what you feel and how you live. it is like you are stuck in your mind, in a thick fog that nobody can enter and that you will not even try to leave. You might have hope. You might not.But tell yourself that : we are thousands and thousands feeling just like you. We all have our little foggy mind of our own and we are all stuck in there and nothing each of us feels is the same as someone else. Pain cannot be compared. We all feel it differently.So even when you are alone. Even when there is no hope. Think about all the other. Who are keeping this fog at bay as hard as they can. Think about us who are struggling to survive. Thousands of us are gone.. but even more even still fight it. So do not let go. We might not be together, but we are all linked somehow.you are not alone. you are not alone. Even if you are alone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              depression    0.0                  1\n",
